Currently, my research is focused on pooling testing (also called group testing), which serves as a cost-effective alternative to individual testing for detection and surveillance of infectious diseases. With the recent advances in assay technology (e.g., nucleic acid amplification test), the use of pooling is becoming increasingly popular. For example, the American Red Cross tests millions of blood donors every year for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) through pooled blood serums. The state of Iowa as part of the nationwide testing program implements a two-stage pooling algorithm to test the state residents for chlamydia and gonorrhea.

The simplest pooling algorithm, introduced in 1943 during the Second World War, involves testing in two hierarchical stages. In stage 1, pools formed by mixing a set of individual specimens (e.g., blood, urine, swabs, etc.) are tested for the presence of a disease. In stage 2, the members of the pools that test negative are tested one by one for case identification purposes. Based on the seminal work, statistical research in this direction has developed profusely and application of pooling has been widespread. As pooling data are naturally complex, the statistical methods using that are also complicated. Consequently, application of the statistical research is non-trivial, especially for practitioners who do not have much background in statistics. Recognizing this as an important issue in public health applications, I write computer programs in R. 

I spent a great deal of time to make the programs computationally efficient and user-friendly. Some parts of the code that involve compute-intensive methods such as the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm are written in FORTRAN and, thus, are computationally optimized (or nearly optimized). Currently, programing resources are uploaded for the following papers.
