Group testing, also known as pool testing, serves as a cost-effective method to test individuals for infectious diseases. For example, the American Red Cross screens thousands of blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) through pooled blood serums. As a statistician, I develop statistical methods for group testing data. I also write R, FORTRAN, and SAS programs to aid public health officials in implementing our methods. The objective of this GitHub application is to disseminate programs and supplementary material of my work.

Currently, I have uploaded R, FORTRAN, and SAS rograms for the following group testing papers:

•	Warasi, M., Tebbs, J., McMahan, C., and Bilder, C. (2016). Estimating the prevalence of multiple diseases from two-stage hierarchical pooling. Statistics in Medicine, 35, 3851-3864.
