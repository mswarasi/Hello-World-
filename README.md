Group testing, also known as pool testing, serves as a cost-effective method to test individuals for infectious diseases. For example, the American Red Cross screens thousands of blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) through pooled blood serums. As a statistician, I develop statistical methods for group testing data. I also write R, FORTRAN, and SAS programs to aid public health officials in implementing our methods. The objective of this GitHub application is to disseminate user-friendly programs and supplementary material.
